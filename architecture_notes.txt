Products.Write.API
	Refactor - Add an application service to coordinate commands
		Should be where events are raised only if the command handler returns success
		Coordinates any other application services that need to be called as part of the command handling
			Straight from controller to command handler is not ideal for managing complexity and application flow
		Change dispatcher to implement MediatR to handle commands
		Use FluentValidation to validate commands
		Use AutoMapper to map between DTOs and domain models
